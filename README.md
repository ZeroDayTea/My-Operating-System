# My-Operating-System
Operating System written in C++ that can print text and manage input from a keyboard

Created by following the tutorial series at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4&list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M and then following my own path with help from http://wiki.osdev.org

Run in a virtual machine or boot using quemu most preferrably (I am not responsible for any damage to your hard drive if you choose to boot from the operating system files)

## Information: ##
----

Created on a Linux Mint 18.3 (Sylvia) system

Created using c++ with exception to some necessary assembler files

Includes support for all alphanumerical keyboard keys and special characters including (";", "'", ",", ".", "/", "\n", " ")
* If you want to add additional support for more keyboard keys add a case to the keyboard.cpp file under the switch(key) switch
